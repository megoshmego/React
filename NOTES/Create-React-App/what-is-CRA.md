Certainly! Here are the relevant code snippets to illustrate the concepts mentioned in the video:

1. Installing Create React App using NPX:
```shell
npx create-react-app first-app
```
In this example, the `npx` command is used to create a new React application called `first-app`. The `create-react-app` package is fetched and executed without the need for a separate global installation.

2. Alternative installation method:
```shell
npm install -g create-react-app
create-react-app first-app
```
If you have an older version of NPM, you can use this alternative method. The first command globally installs the `create-react-app` package, and the second command creates a new React application called `first-app`.

These code snippets demonstrate how to use `npx create-react-app` or `create-react-app` commands to set up a new React application using Create React App. The tool simplifies the process of creating and managing React projects by handling dependencies, bundling, testing, and other useful features.
