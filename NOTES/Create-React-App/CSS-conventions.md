Certainly! Here are code snippets to illustrate the concepts mentioned in the video:

1. Using the `style` attribute with inline styles:
```javascript
const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p style={{ color: 'magenta' }}>Some text with magenta color</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

2. Using dynamic styles based on props:
```javascript
const Alert = ({ variant = 'success', children }) => {
  const colors = {
    success: 'green',
    danger: 'red',
    warning: 'yellow',
  };

  const alertStyle = {
    backgroundColor: colors[variant],
  };

  return (
    <div className="alert" style={alertStyle}>
      {children}
    </div>
  );
};

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Alert variant="success">Welcome back!</Alert>
      <Alert variant="danger">Oh no, danger!</Alert>
    </div>
  );
};
```

Please note that the `Alert` component assumes the existence of a CSS class named "alert" for additional styling. The dynamic styles are applied through the `style` attribute.

It's important to understand that while inline styles can be used for dynamic styling, it's generally recommended to separate static styles into a separate CSS file and use CSS classes instead. The `style` attribute should be used sparingly for cases where styles need to be calculated or modified dynamically.

Also, remember that CSS properties in inline styles use camelCase instead of kebab-case, and the values are provided as strings or valid CSS property values.

Ensure that you have a clear understanding of CSS styling in React, including the use of inline styles, dynamic styles, CSS classes, and CSS modules, as they all play important roles in building React components with different styling requirements.
