Certainly! Here are code snippets to illustrate the concepts mentioned in the video:

1. Starting the React App:
```shell
# Terminal command
npm start
```
Running `npm start` in the terminal starts the React development server and opens the application in the browser.

2. Skeleton of Create React App project:
- README file: A file with instructions and information about the project.
- package.json: Contains the project configuration and dependencies.
- public folder:
  - index.html: The HTML file that serves as the entry point of the React application.
- src folder:
  - App.js: The default component provided by Create React App.
  - App.css: CSS file for styling the App component.

3. Importing and exporting modules:
```javascript
// Importing a module
import React from 'react';

// Exporting a module
export default App;
```
In this example, `React` is imported from the 'react' module using the `import` keyword. The `App` component is exported as the default export using the `export default` syntax.

Note: These code snippets provide a general understanding of the concepts discussed in the video. The actual implementation and usage may vary based on the specific requirements of your project.
