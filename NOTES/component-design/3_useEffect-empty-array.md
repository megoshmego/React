Certainly! Here are the code snippets illustrating the concepts discussed in the video:

1. Using Dependencies with `useEffect`:
```jsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

function MyComponent(props) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Effect code here
  }, [count]);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>{count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, the `useEffect` hook is used with a dependency array containing `[count]`. The effect will only run if the value of `count` changes. React will watch the `count` variable and run the effect whenever it changes.

2. Using an Empty Dependency Array:
```jsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  useEffect(() => {
    // Effect code here (runs after the first render only)
  }, []);

  return <div>Component Content</div>;
}
```

In this example, the `useEffect` hook is used with an empty dependency array `[]`. This tells React to run the effect only after the first render and not run it again for subsequent renders. The effect code will only execute once during the component's lifecycle.

These code snippets demonstrate how to use dependencies with `useEffect`, either by specifying specific dependencies or using an empty array for effects that should run once or only after the initial render.
