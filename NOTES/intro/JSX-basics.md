The script you shared covers several key concepts related to React and JSX. Below I'll summarize the concepts discussed and provide some code examples to illustrate them.

1. **JSX**: JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that resembles HTML. It's used with React to describe what the UI should look like.

    For example, a basic JSX syntax could be like this:
    ```jsx
    const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
    ```

2. **JSX Transpilation**: Because browsers can't interpret JSX directly, it needs to be "transpiled" to regular JavaScript. This is often done using a tool called Babel.

3. **Self-closing tags in JSX**: Unlike in HTML, all elements in JSX must be closed. If an element doesn't have any children, it must be closed with a slash.

    Here is an example of self-closing tags in JSX:
    ```jsx
    const element = <img src="image.jpg" />;
    ```

4. **Returning Single Elements in Components**: In React, each component must return a single JSX element. This doesn't mean the component can only return one item - that single JSX element can contain many child elements.

    Here's an example of a component that returns multiple items inside a single parent JSX element:

    ```jsx
    function MyComponent() {
      return (
        <div>
          <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
          <p>Welcome to my website.</p>
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```

5. **Implicit Return in Arrow Functions**: In JavaScript, if an arrow function body consists of a single expression, you can use an "implicit return" to return the result of that expression without using the `return` keyword.

    Here's an example of an implicit return in a React component:

    ```jsx
    const MyComponent = () => (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my website.</p>
      </div>
    );
    ```

6. **Class-Based Components**: In React, components can be defined as classes. These class-based components have more features than functional components, but the latter are more commonly used as of React Hooks introduction.

    Here's an example of a class-based component:

    ```jsx
    class MyComponent extends React.Component {
      render() {
        return (
          <div>
            <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
            <p>Welcome to my website.</p>
          </div>
        );
      }
    }
    ```
   
Remember, the above rules are primarily applicable when working with JSX and React. The regular rules of JavaScript apply otherwise. For instance, HTML tags inside JavaScript (but outside JSX) don't have to be closed.
