Sure, I can provide the code snippets that are talked about in the script. Here are some key concepts and their corresponding code examples from the video:

**1. Creating an HTML file with a basic structure**
Here is an example of a basic HTML structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Shebaz</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

**2. Including React, ReactDOM and Babel dependencies**
These can be included through CDN links:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react@16/umd/react.development.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/babel-standalone@6/babel.min.js"></script>
```

**3. Creating a new React Component**
A component can be a function that returns JSX (a syntax that looks like HTML):

```javascript
function Sheba() {
  return <img src="URL_TO_SHEBA_IMAGE" alt="Sheba Inu" />;
}
```

**4. Rendering the React Component**
You render a React component to the DOM using the ReactDOM.render() function:

```javascript
ReactDOM.render(<Sheba />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

**5. Including the JavaScript file in the HTML**
This is done using a script tag:

```html
<script type="text/babel" src="Sheba.js"></script>
```

**Note:** The type attribute must be set to "text/babel" to let Babel know that this file uses JSX.

So, in short, you first create an HTML file with basic structure, then you include your dependencies like React, ReactDOM, and Babel. After that, you create a new React component (in this case `Sheba`), and render it into a DOM node. You must then include this JS file in your HTML file using a script tag with a specific type attribute ("text/babel") to allow Babel to transpile the JSX.
