This video script is about React components and their definition, specifically the transition from class-based components to functional components with the introduction of React Hooks. Below are key terms you might want to study:

1. **React Components**: Components are independent, reusable pieces in React. They serve as the building blocks of any React application.

2. **Class Components**: These are more traditional in React and defined using ES6 classes. Here is a simple example of a class component:

    ```jsx
    import React, { Component } from 'react';

    class Greeting extends Component {
        render() {
            return <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
        }
    }

    export default Greeting;
    ```
    In this code snippet, `Greeting` is a class-based component which extends the `Component` class from React library. The `render` method is used to define what the UI of this component will look like.

3. **Functional Components**: These are simpler and more modern way to define components in React. They're just JavaScript functions that return JSX. Here's how the above example would look as a functional component:

    ```jsx
    import React from 'react';

    const Greeting = () => {
        return <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
    }

    export default Greeting;
    ```
    Here, `Greeting` is a functional component. It's a simple JavaScript function that returns a JSX element.

4. **React Hooks**: Hooks are a relatively new addition to React (added in React 16.8) that let you use state and other React features in functional components. Prior to Hooks, these features were only available in class components. One of the most frequently used hooks is `useState`. Here is an example of a functional component with a hook:

    ```jsx
    import React, { useState } from 'react';

    const Counter = () => {
        const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

        return (
            <div>
                <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
                <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
                    Click me
                </button>
            </div>
        );
    }

    export default Counter;
    ```
    In this example, `useState` is a Hook (we say "hook into the React state"). It declares a "state variable". Our variable is called `count` but we could call it anything else, like `banana`. This is a way to "preserve" some values between the function calls â€” `useState` is a new way to use the exact same capabilities that `this.state` provides in a class.

Please note that React documentation provides a great introduction to these concepts, and there are many online tutorials and resources that you can use to practice.
