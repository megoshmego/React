Certainly! Here's an example code snippet to illustrate the concepts discussed in the video regarding the use of state and props in React:

```jsx
function GameBoard({ numRows, numColumns }) {
  const [score, setScore] = useState(0);
  const [gameOver, setGameOver] = useState(false);

  // ... rest of the component logic

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Game Board</h2>
      <p>Number of rows: {numRows}</p>
      <p>Number of columns: {numColumns}</p>
      <p>Score: {score}</p>
      {gameOver ? <p>Game Over!</p> : <p>Game in progress</p>}
      {/* rest of the JSX */}
    </div>
  );
}

// Usage example
<GameBoard numRows={3} numColumns={3} />
```

In this example, the `GameBoard` component represents a game board. The number of rows (`numRows`) and number of columns (`numColumns`) are passed as props to the component. These props define the initial configuration of the game board and are expected to remain static throughout the game.

The `score` and `gameOver` variables are maintained as state using the `useState` hook. The `score` state represents the score of the game, which is expected to change as the game progresses. The `gameOver` state indicates whether the game has ended or is still in progress.

By distinguishing between props and state, we can identify which data is expected to be static (props) and which data can change over time (state). In this case, the number of rows and columns are passed as props since they define the initial configuration, while the score and game state are managed as state within the component.

This example demonstrates a basic understanding of when to use state and when to use props, depending on whether the data is expected to change or remain static within a component.
