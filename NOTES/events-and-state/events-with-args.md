Certainly! Here's an example code snippet to illustrate the concepts discussed in the video about passing arguments to callbacks in React:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function ButtonGroup() {
  const printColor = (color) => {
    console.log(`You clicked ${color}`);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => printColor('red')}>Red</button>
      <button onClick={() => printColor('yellow')}>Yellow</button>
      <button onClick={() => printColor('green')}>Green</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default ButtonGroup;
```

In this example, the `ButtonGroup` component renders three buttons: "Red," "Yellow," and "Green." Each button has an `onClick` event handler that calls the `printColor` function.

To pass arguments to the `printColor` function when a button is clicked, an inline arrow function is used in the `onClick` event handler. Inside the arrow function, `printColor` is invoked with the desired argument (`'red'`, `'yellow'`, or `'green'` in this case).

The `printColor` function takes an argument `color` and logs a message to the console using a string template literal. The value of `color` is interpolated into the template string to display the corresponding color name.

By using the inline arrow function and passing arguments to the callback, we can ensure that the correct value is passed to the `printColor` function when a button is clicked. This pattern allows us to customize the behavior of the callback based on the specific event and data associated with it.

Note that this pattern of using inline arrow functions to pass arguments to callbacks is a common practice in React, especially when working with event handlers and dynamically generated components.
