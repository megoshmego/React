Certainly! Here are some code snippets to illustrate the concepts discussed in the video regarding event handling in React:

1. Example of onClick event:
```jsx
function handleClick() {
  console.log('Button clicked!');
}

<button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>
```

In this example, the `handleClick` function is an event handler for the `onClick` event. When the button is clicked, the function is called, and it logs a message to the console.

2. Example of onMouseOver event:
```jsx
function handleMouseOver() {
  console.log('Mouse over event triggered!');
}

<div onMouseOver={handleMouseOver}>Hover over me</div>
```

In this example, the `handleMouseOver` function is an event handler for the `onMouseOver` event. When the mouse is moved over the `<div>` element, the function is called, and it logs a message to the console.

3. Example of onScroll event:
```jsx
function handleScroll() {
  console.log('Scroll event triggered!');
}

<textarea rows={2} onScroll={handleScroll}>
  Some text to scroll through...
</textarea>
```

In this example, the `handleScroll` function is an event handler for the `onScroll` event of a `<textarea>` element. When the content inside the textarea is scrolled, the function is called, and it logs a message to the console.

These examples demonstrate how to use event handlers in React by attaching event listeners to JSX elements. The event names are camel-cased (`onClick`, `onMouseOver`, `onScroll`), and the event handlers are passed as function references (`handleClick`, `handleMouseOver`, `handleScroll`) to trigger specific actions when the corresponding events occur.
