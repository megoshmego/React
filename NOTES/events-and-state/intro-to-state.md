Certainly! Here are some code snippets to illustrate the concepts discussed in the video regarding state in React:

1. Class-based component with state:
```jsx
// Example: Class-based component with state
class Clock extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { date: new Date() };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    this.timerID = setInterval(() => this.tick(), 1000);
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    clearInterval(this.timerID);
  }

  tick() {
    this.setState({ date: new Date() });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Current Time:</h1>
        <p>{this.state.date.toLocaleTimeString()}</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

// Usage:
<Clock />
```

In this example, the `Clock` component is a class-based component that uses state to store the current time (`date`). The `componentDidMount` method sets up an interval to update the time every second, and the `componentWillUnmount` method clears the interval when the component is unmounted. The `tick` method is responsible for updating the state and triggering a re-render of the component.

2. Functional component with state using the State Hook:
```jsx
// Example: Functional component with state using the State Hook
function Clock() {
  const [date, setDate] = useState(new Date());

  useEffect(() => {
    const timerID = setInterval(() => {
      setDate(new Date());
    }, 1000);

    return () => {
      clearInterval(timerID);
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Current Time:</h1>
      <p>{date.toLocaleTimeString()}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

// Usage:
<Clock />
```

In this example, the `Clock` component is a functional component that uses the State Hook (`useState`) to manage the state of the current time (`date`). The `useEffect` hook is used to set up and clean up the interval for updating the time. The state is updated using the `setDate` function, and the component is re-rendered accordingly.

These examples demonstrate how state can be implemented both in class-based components (using the `constructor` and `setState` method) and functional components (using the State Hook and `useState`). It's important to note that functional components with Hooks are the preferred approach in modern React development.
