Certainly! Here's an example code snippet to illustrate the concepts discussed in the video about using state in a React component:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(99);

  const handleAdd = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  const handleSubtract = () => {
    setCount(count - 1);
  };

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Count: {count}</h1>
      <button onClick={handleAdd}>Add</button>
      <button onClick={handleSubtract}>Subtract</button>
    </>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```

In this example, the `Counter` component utilizes the `useState` hook from React to manage a count state. The `useState` hook is imported from the `react` package. It is called within the component and returns an array with two elements: the current state value (`count`) and a function to update the state (`setCount`).

The initial value of the state is set to 99 using `useState(99)`. This initial value will be assigned to the `count` variable. The `setCount` function is used to update the `count` state. When `setCount` is called with a new value, it will trigger a re-render of the component, updating the state and reflecting the changes in the DOM.

The `handleAdd` and `handleSubtract` functions are event handlers for the "Add" and "Subtract" buttons, respectively. They call `setCount` with the updated value based on the current `count` state. This allows the count to increase or decrease by one whenever the corresponding button is clicked.

Within the component's return statement, the current value of `count` is displayed in an `h1` element. The `handleAdd` and `handleSubtract` functions are assigned to the `onClick` event handlers of the buttons, allowing the user to interact with the count state.

By utilizing `useState`, the component can maintain and update its own internal state, enabling dynamic behavior and reactivity based on user interactions.
