Certainly! Here are some code snippets that illustrate the concepts mentioned in the video:

1. Smoke Test for App Component:
```javascript
// app.test.js
import React from 'react';
import { render } from '@testing-library/react';
import App from './App';

test('it renders without crashing', () => {
  render(<App />);
});
```

2. Smoke Test for Counter Component:
```javascript
// counter.test.js
import React from 'react';
import { render } from '@testing-library/react';
import Counter from './Counter';

test('it renders without crashing', () => {
  render(<Counter />);
});
```

3. Smoke Test for Broken Component (to demonstrate a failure):
```javascript
// brokenComponent.test.js
import React from 'react';
import { render } from '@testing-library/react';
import BrokenComponent from './BrokenComponent';

test('it renders without crashing', () => {
  render(<BrokenComponent />);
});
```

In these code snippets, the `render` method from the `@testing-library/react` library is used to render the components (`App`, `Counter`, or `BrokenComponent`) into a virtual DOM. The test verifies if the component can render without throwing any errors or crashing. If the component fails to render, an error will be thrown during the test execution.

These smoke tests provide a basic level of verification, ensuring that the components can render properly before further testing is conducted.
