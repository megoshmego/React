Certainly! Here are code snippets to illustrate the concepts discussed in the video about debugging tests using the debug method and breakpoints:

Debug Method:
```jsx
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import App from './App';

test('renders the App component', () => {
  const { debug } = render(<App />);
  debug();
});
```

In this example, the `debug` method is called after rendering the `App` component. The `debug` method is destructured from the object returned by the `render` function. When the test is executed, it will print a text version of the component's structure in the console. This helps to inspect the rendered DOM and understand the component's state at a given point in time.

Breakpoint with Debugger:
```jsx
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import Counter from './Counter';

test('increments the counter by two', () => {
  debugger; // Add a breakpoint
  render(<Counter />);
  // Rest of the test code
});
```

In this example, a breakpoint is added using the `debugger` statement within a test case. When the test is run with debugging enabled, it will pause the execution at the breakpoint. This allows you to use debugging tools, step through code, inspect variables, and interact with the test environment. In this case, the `Counter` component is rendered, and further assertions or interactions can be performed while the test is paused.

Please note that breakpoints and the `debug` method are useful debugging tools but should be used judiciously. It's important to remove or disable breakpoints and avoid excessive debugging statements in production code.
