In this video, the instructor discusses the concept of creating custom hooks in React to extract and reuse logic from components. Here are some relevant terms and concepts mentioned:

1. Custom Hooks: Custom hooks are JavaScript functions that allow you to reuse logic between multiple React components. They are created by extracting common logic from components into separate functions that can be called from different components. Custom hooks follow a naming convention of starting with the word "use" (e.g., `useToggle`, `useFetch`). Custom hooks enable code organization and reusability, making it easier to manage complex logic in applications.

2. State and useState: The `useState` hook is a built-in React hook that allows functional components to have state. It takes an initial value and returns an array with two elements: the current state value and a function to update that value. State can be used to manage and track changes in a component.

3. JSX: JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension in React that allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript. It provides a way to describe the structure and content of UI components.

4. Event Handling: React components can handle events, such as clicks or input changes, by attaching event handlers to JSX elements. Event handlers are functions that are executed when a specific event occurs, allowing you to define custom behavior for user interactions.

5. CSS and Styling: Styling in React can be done using CSS classes or inline styles. CSS classes can be applied to JSX elements using the `className` attribute, allowing you to define styles in separate CSS files and import them into your components.

6. Ternary Operator: The ternary operator (`condition ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse`) is a concise way to conditionally render content in React components. It evaluates the condition and returns one of two values based on the result.

7. Code Organization and Modularity: Custom hooks provide a way to organize and modularize code by encapsulating logic into separate functions. By creating custom hooks, you can promote code reuse, improve readability, and make it easier to maintain and test your codebase.

These are some of the key terms and concepts discussed in the video related to creating custom hooks in React. Studying these concepts will help you understand how to extract and reuse logic effectively in your React applications.
