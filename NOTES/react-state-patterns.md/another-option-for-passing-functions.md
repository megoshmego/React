Certainly! Here are code snippets that correspond to the concepts mentioned in the video:

1. Running Jest Tests:
   By default, Create React App sets up Jest as the testing framework, and you can run tests using the `npm test` command. Here's an example of a simple test using Jest:

```jsx
test('1 equals 1', () => {
  expect(1).toBe(1);
});
```

2. Introduction to React Testing Library:
   React Testing Library is a popular testing library for React applications. It focuses on writing tests that resemble how users interact with the application. Here's an example of using React Testing Library:

```jsx
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import App from './App';

test('renders App component', () => {
  render(<App />);
  const appElement = screen.getByText('Welcome to My App');
  expect(appElement).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

3. Selecting Elements by Text with React Testing Library:
   React Testing Library provides methods to select elements based on their text content. Here's an example:

```jsx
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import Button from './Button';

test('finds a button by text', () => {
  render(<Button label="Click me" />);
  const buttonElement = screen.getByText('Click me');
  expect(buttonElement).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

These code snippets demonstrate the usage of Jest and React Testing Library to write tests for React components. Keep in mind that these snippets may not be complete and may require additional setup or assertions depending on the specific test case.
