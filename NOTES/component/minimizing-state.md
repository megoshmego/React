Certainly! Here's a code snippet that illustrates the concept of "Dumb" components and the relationship between parent and child components:

```jsx
// Dumb Component
const TodoItem = ({ todo }) => {
  return <div>{todo.title}</div>;
};

// Parent Component
const TodoList = () => {
  const todos = [
    { id: 1, title: 'Buy groceries' },
    { id: 2, title: 'Walk the dog' },
    { id: 3, title: 'Do laundry' },
  ];

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Todo List</h1>
      {todos.map((todo) => (
        <TodoItem key={todo.id} todo={todo} />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};

export default TodoList;
```

In this code, the `TodoItem` component is an example of a "Dumb" or stateless component. It receives the `todo` object as a prop and renders the title of the todo item. This component doesn't have its own state but relies on the `todo` prop passed down from the parent component.

The `TodoList` component acts as the parent component and renders multiple instances of the "Dumb" `TodoItem` component. It defines an array of `todos` and maps over the array to render each `TodoItem` component with the respective `todo` object as a prop.

This pattern demonstrates the concept of having a smarter parent component (`TodoList`) that manages state and logic while rendering simpler child components (`TodoItem`) that focus on presentation. The parent component passes down data (`todo` objects) to the child components via props.

Understanding this parent-child relationship and deciding where to store state is an important aspect of React development. It allows for centralized state management and easier coordination between components.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
