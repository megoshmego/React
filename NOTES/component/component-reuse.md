Certainly! Here are some code snippets that illustrate the concepts mentioned in the script:

1. Small and Reusable Components:

```jsx
// Example 1: Product Cart Component
const ProductCart = ({ image, price, title }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <img src={image} alt={title} />
      <h3>{title}</h3>
      <p>{price}</p>
      <Button>Add to Cart</Button>
    </div>
  );
};

// Example 2: Avatar Component
const Avatar = ({ imageUrl, size, isLink }) => {
  const avatarStyle = {
    width: size,
    height: size,
    borderRadius: "50%",
  };

  if (isLink) {
    return (
      <a href="#">
        <img src={imageUrl} alt="Avatar" style={avatarStyle} />
      </a>
    );
  }

  return <img src={imageUrl} alt="Avatar" style={avatarStyle} />;
};
```

In the first example, we have a `ProductCart` component that represents a product card. It receives props like `image`, `price`, and `title` and renders them along with an "Add to Cart" button. This component can be reused multiple times in different parts of the application.

In the second example, we have an `Avatar` component that displays a circular avatar image. It accepts props such as `imageUrl`, `size`, and `isLink`. Based on the `isLink` prop, it renders either a simple image or a clickable image wrapped in an anchor tag. This component demonstrates how a single component can behave differently based on props, allowing for reusability and flexibility.

2. Component Structure and Hierarchy:

```jsx
const PhotoPopup = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <OwnerHeader />
      <CommentList>
        <Comment />
        <Comment />
        {/* ... */}
      </CommentList>
    </div>
  );
};

const OwnerHeader = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <OwnerAvatar />
      <OwnerInfo />
    </div>
  );
};

const Comment = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <CommenterAvatar />
      <CommentContent />
    </div>
  );
};
```

In this example, we have a hypothetical photo popup component. The `PhotoPopup` component represents the overall structure of the popup, including the owner's header section and a list of comments. The `OwnerHeader` component handles rendering the owner's avatar and additional information. The `Comment` component represents a single comment, including the commenter's avatar and the comment content. By breaking down the components into smaller, focused pieces, it becomes easier to manage and reuse them.

These code snippets demonstrate the idea of creating small, reusable components and organizing them in a structured hierarchy to improve reusability, maintainability, and code clarity.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
