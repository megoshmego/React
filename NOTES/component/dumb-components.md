Certainly! Here's a code snippet illustrating the concept of "Dumb" components in React:

```jsx
// Dumb Component
const Button = ({ onClick, label }) => {
  return <button onClick={onClick}>{label}</button>;
};

// Parent Component
const App = () => {
  const handleClick = () => {
    console.log('Button clicked!');
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Parent Component</h1>
      <Button onClick={handleClick} label="Click me" />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

In this code, the `Button` component is an example of a "Dumb" or stateless component. It receives the `onClick` function as a prop and renders a button element with the provided label. This component doesn't have its own state but relies on the `onClick` prop to handle any necessary functionality.

The `App` component acts as the parent component and renders the "Dumb" `Button` component. It defines the `handleClick` function, which is passed as a prop to the `Button` component. The `App` component can handle state and logic while the `Button` component remains simple and focused on presentation.

The concept of "Dumb" components is commonly used in React to separate concerns and promote reusability. These components receive data and functions as props from their parent components and don't manage their own state.

I hope this clarifies the concept! Let me know if you have any further questions.
